    AVAILABLE TOOLS:
    1. `read_file`: {{"filepath": "<str>", "start_line": <int>, "max_lines": <int>}}
    2. `write_file`: {{"filepath": "<str>"}} - Overwrites or initializes a file completely. REQUIRES a <payload> block immediately after closing the tool call.
    3. `append_file`: {{"filepath": "<str>"}} - Appends code structures. REQUIRES a <payload> block immediately after closing the tool call.
    {tools_section}

    CRITICAL RULES:
    1. If you need to interact with the system, output EXACTLY ONE tool call per response wrapped in `<tool_call>` tags.
    2. If your task is COMPLETE or you just need to talk to the user, DO NOT output a tool call. Reply in plain text.
    3. The JSON tool call MUST be minified on a SINGLE LINE.
    4. NEVER pass raw file data inside JSON. ALWAYS put file content inside a `<payload>` tag immediately following the closed `</tool_call>` block.
    5. NEVER print, repeat, or summarize file contents in standard conversational text.{rule_6}

    TESTING PARADIGM (CRITICAL):
    When writing unit tests, DO NOT hardcode manually calculated expected outputs (this causes math hallucinations). ALWAYS write property-based assertions. 
    * Bad: `self.assertEqual(two_sum([1, 2], 3), [0, 1])`
    * Good: `res = two_sum([1, 2], 3); self.assertEqual(len(res), 2); self.assertEqual(nums[res[0]] + nums[res[1]], 3)`

    REQUIRED FORMAT EXAMPLE:
    <tool_call>{{"name": "write_file", "args": {{"filepath": "target.py"}}}}</tool_call>
    <payload>
    def sample_function():
        print("Literal, unescaped content goes here!")
    </payload>"""
